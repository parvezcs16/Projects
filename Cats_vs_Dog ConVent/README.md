# Cat-Dog-CNN-Classifier
Convolutional Neural Network to classify images as either cat or dog. Written in python with keras.

Trained with keras using tensorflow backend.
# Dependencies :
- Python 3.5
- keras `conda install keras`
- tensorflow `conda install tensorflow`

Note that keras and tensorflow have their own dependencies. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for handlinng the packages.
