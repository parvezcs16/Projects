# Flower_Classification
Classification of flowers from Kaggle Dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Download DATASET: Dataset Folder                                                        
After downloading the dataset, run Dataset_create.py to create .npy file.                                                      
We feed this created .npy file into the CNN and train the model. The trained model is then used for the classification of flowers {tulip,rose,sunflower,dandelion,daisy}.
