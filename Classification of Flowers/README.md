# Flower_Classification
Classification of flowers from Kaggle Dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Download DATASET: Dataset Folder                                                        
After downloading the dataset, run Dataset_create.py to create .npy file.                                                      
We feed this created .npy file into the CNN and train the model. The trained model is then used for the classification of flowers {tulip,rose,sunflower,dandelion,daisy}.

# Dependencies :
- Python 3.5
- keras `conda install keras`
- tensorflow `conda install tensorflow`

Note that keras and tensorflow have their own dependencies. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for handlinng the packages.
