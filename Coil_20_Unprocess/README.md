### COIL-20

A convolutional neural network for image classification, using a subset of the
[COIL-20](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-20.php) image dataset - 
three classes to be more precise, rubber-duck, mug, pigbank. It uses Google's pretrained Inception V3 model. 

# Dependencies :
- Python 3.5
- keras `conda install keras`
- tensorflow `conda install tensorflow`

Note that keras and tensorflow have their own dependencies. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for handlinng the packages.
